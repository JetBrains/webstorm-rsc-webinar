# Essentials of React Server Components

React Server Components is probably the most hotly discussed topic right now in the React ecosystem. Since the introduction of React hooks, this is by far the biggest change in the landscape and will fundamentally change the way React applications are written. Or will it?

In this webinar, Christian and Jan-Niklas will introduce you to Server-Side Rendering using React Server Components by developing a sample application from scratch. This will provide you with an overview of core principles and fundamental patterns, enabling you to leverage React Server Components for your projects.

Join us to learn how React enables Server-Side-Rendering capabilities while providing the developer experience you are already familiar with.
